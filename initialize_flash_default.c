	// force. We start with a median force (DC_INITIALIZE_FLASH_INTENSITY_FORCE_MEDIAN) 
	// and subtract that from the real force. Then we mutiply the result by a factor 
	// of DC_INITIALIZE_FLASH_INTENSITY_FORCE_MUTIPLIER to give it more variance and 
	// subtract the total value from DC_INITIALIZE_FLASH_INTENSITY_BASE. 
	
	// As an example, assume DC_INITIALIZE_FLASH_INTENSITY_BASE is 100.
	//
	// If DC_INITIALIZE_FLASH_INTENSITY_FORCE_MEDIAN is 10, an attack damage 
	// of 10 is DC_INITIALIZE_FLASH_INTENSITY_BASE (i.e. 100% intensity), so

	// DC_INITIALIZE_FLASH_INTENSITY_FORCE_MUTIPLIER is 4, then intensity 
	// will be 120. Damage of 15 would produce an intensity of 80. 
	
	// Once we have an intensity value we can use it to control size of flash 
	// and speed of sound playback to create a dynamic experience. This is 
	// based on OpenBOR's native damage based hitfx playback speed. It's important
